<h2>Appeal your grade</h2>
<p>If you feel you were unfairly graded, you can submit an appeal to regrade. Please note that your appeal will be seen by a staff member, and eats into the time they'd otherwise use to improve the class, answer your questions on the forum etc. So, please only submit a request if you think you truly deserve a regrade. </p>

<p><strong>Regrades will not always end in your favor!</strong> If we feel that your request is unwarranted (e.g. your answer is actually wrong), or that your current grade is higher than is fair, we will reduce your grade to the right value, and in addition, you'll incur a penalty of 7 points (the maximum score on the quiz is five points, so it's never worth requesting a regrade just to try your luck!) We have this policy to ensure that we can devote attention to legitimate requests, and to teaching the class.</p>

<p>That being said, we trust our students (who, we believe, abide by the honor code). So, we will update your grade immediately when you submit this form. Of course, if your request is not legitimate, we will change your grade as above</p>
