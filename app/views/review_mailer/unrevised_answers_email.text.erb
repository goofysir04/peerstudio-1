Hey <%= @user.name%>!

Your MOOC-mates have recently given you feedback on your draft for <%=@assignment.title%>. Just a friendly reminder to rate and hopefully, use this feedback to improve your work :)

Remember that you must give two MOOC-mates feedback before you can see your own, so helping your MOOC-mate helps you!
