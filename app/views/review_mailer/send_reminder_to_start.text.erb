Hello <%= @user.name%>!

As you’ve learned in Learning How to Learn, it takes time to build memory and mastery. Now, it’s time to put what you’ve learned into practice. 

<%= @assignment.title%> is a way of applying what you’ve learned in Learning How To Learn to your own life and goals. Put what you've learned about procrastination into practice, and start the project today. 

As a first step, think about what story you want to convey. Pick the medium you want to use to convey it, as well as the three main topics you want to focus on.

After starting, submit your draft on Peerstudio, and you'll get feedback from your MOOC-mates the same day!
