Hey <%= @user.name%>!

Remember, your assignment "<%= @assignment.title %>" is due TODAY. I hope you got great feedback from your mooc-mates on Peerstudio. 

Your essay will only be graded if you submit it on Coursera, not just on Peerstudio. So, if you haven't already, you should submit on Coursera RIGHT NOW. 

To help you out, here's what you need to know:

1. Here's your latest draft: <%= answer_reviews_url(@answer) %>. You should copy your answer from here. 

2. Go to https://class.coursera.org/learning-001/human_grading/view/courses/972423/assessments/2/submissions

3. Paste your essay in and click "Submit for grading"

It is your responsibility to submit your assignment on time so that you can get your grade. It only takes a few minutes, so I strongly recommend you do it now.

Good luck,
Chinmay from Peerstudio
